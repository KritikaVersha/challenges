`https://staging.trypico.com/signup` 
`https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form` 
`https://www.guru99.com/live-testing-project.html` 


1. Create a strategy or plan document that describes your approach and the test cases you will execute. Include in the plan xpath or element/selector details needed for each test.
2. Use a tool or framework you are comfortable with to execute the plan.
3. Produce a simple report with the results of the tests, including defects or blockers encountered. A spreadsheet or doc is fine.


#### 2. Write a performance test of a publically available API endpoint that requires a POST payload. You can use a Pico API endpoint if you want, but any that you choose would be acceptable, as long as it is a POST request.

`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/` 

1. Create a strategy or plan document that describes your approach
2. Use a tool like Apache A/B, JMeter, or Blazemeter to execute the test.
3. Produce a simple histogram describing the response performance of the endpoint over time and as the number of requests increases.
